    "In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It's a frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course, even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it's a commonly understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect of the lifestyle one leads.\n",

    "Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this information. For example, if a manager of a restaurant already knows the demographic of his current customers, they'd ideally want to open at a location where this demographic is at its highest concentration, ensuring short commute times to the location and more customers served.If potential hotel locations are being evaluated, a site that caters to a wide variety of tastes would be ideal, since one would want every guest to have something to their liking.\n",

    "# Run K-means Clustering on the data\n",
    "K Means Clustering will help us group locations based on the amenities located around them. For example, a location with a high amount of shops nearby will be labeled \"Amenity Rich\" while a location with less amenities will be labeled \"Amenity Poor\". Similar locations will be grouped (clustered) together.\n",

    "### Properties of clusters\n",
    "- All the data points in a cluster should be similar to each other. <br>\n",
    "- The data points from different clusters should be as different as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation matrix for clustering\n",
    "#### Inertia (Works for first property)\n",
    "Inertia calculates the sum of distances of all the points within a cluster from the centroid of that cluster. <br>Hence, the distance between them should be as low as possible.\n",
    "#### Dunn Index (Works for second property)\n",
    "This distance between the centroids of two different clusters is known as inter-cluster distance.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Dunn Index = min(Inter cluster distance) / max(Intra cluster distance)\n",
    "<br>The more the value of the Dunn index, the better will be the clusters.\n",
    "#### Steps of K-means clustering\n",
    "1. Choose the number of clusters k\n",
    "2. Select k random points from the data as centroids\n",
    "3. Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid\n",
    "4. Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3 and 4\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stopping Criteria\n",
    "1. Centroids of newly formed clusters do not change\n",
    "2. Points remain in the same cluster\n",
    "3. Maximum number of iterations are reached\n"

    "We randomly initialize the centroids in k-means clustering. This is also potentially problematic because we might get different clusters every time. So, to solve this problem of random initialization, there is an algorithm called K-Means++ that can be used to choose the initial values, or the initial cluster centroids, for K-Means."

    "## K-Means++ to Choose Initial Cluster Centroids for K-Means Clustering\n",
    "It specifies a procedure to initialize the cluster centers before moving forward with the standard k-means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first cluster is chosen uniformly at random from the data points that we want to cluster. This is similar to what we do in K-Means, but instead of randomly picking all the centroids, we just pick one centroid here\n",
    "2. Next, we compute the distance (D(x)) of each data point (x) from the cluster center that has already been chosen\n",
    "3. Then, choose the new cluster center from the data points with the probability of x being proportional to (D(x))^2. The next centroid will be the one whose squared distance (D(x)2) is the farthest from the current centroid.\n",
    "4. We then repeat steps 2 and 3 until k clusters have been chosen\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue with the K-Means algorithm after initializing the centroids. Using K-Means++ to initialize the centroids tends to improve the clusters. Although it is computationally costly relative to random initialization, subsequent K-Means often converge more rapidly."

    "## How to Choose the Right Number of Clusters in K-Means Clustering?\n",
    "One thing we can do is plot a graph, also known as an elbow curve, where the x-axis will represent the number of clusters and the y-axis will be an evaluation metric.\n",
    "- The cluster value where this decrease in inertia value becomes constant can be chosen as the right cluster value for our data.\n",
    "- You must also look at the computation cost while deciding the number of clusters. Increase the number of clusters, the computation cost will also increase. "
