    "In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It's a frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course, even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it's a commonly understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect of the lifestyle one leads.\n",

    "Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this information. For example, if a manager of a restaurant already knows the demographic of his current customers, they'd ideally want to open at a location where this demographic is at its highest concentration, ensuring short commute times to the location and more customers served.If potential hotel locations are being evaluated, a site that caters to a wide variety of tastes would be ideal, since one would want every guest to have something to their liking.\n",
